"""
Transition planning: for an ordered pair (A -> B) decide *how* to move between
them — where A leaves, where B enters, how long the blend is, whether a clean
beatmatch is possible, how to phase-align on beats/phrases, and which effects
serve the transition.

Quality principles baked in here:
  * Only stretch B's short overlap head, and only within the allowed limit — the
    bodies of tracks stay at native tempo (preserves quality/pitch).
  * Snap the exit and entry to phrase (8-bar) boundaries so blends are musical.
  * If a clean beatmatch isn't possible, don't force a bad time-stretch — fall
    back to a filter/echo transition on a phrase boundary.
  * Never overlap two full-energy bass sections (the EQ engine bass-swaps).
